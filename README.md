# 🚀 **ServLink — Your Smart Service Connection App**

---

## 🧩 **Overview**

ServLink is a **mobile-first application** built to **connect customers with trusted local service providers** — from home maintenance and cleaning to IT support, tutoring, and more.  
We designed it to **simplify the service process**:  
**search 🔍 → book 📅 → get the job done ⚡.**

> 💡 **Built for speed, clarity, and real usability.**

## 🎯 **Why We Built This App**

In today’s digital world, people expect **services on demand — anytime, anywhere, from their phone.**  
Existing apps usually focus on one niche (like cleaning or moving). **ServLink** is different:  
we connect **all service types under one ecosystem**, empowering both **customers and providers.**

We built **ServLink** as a **mobile-first app (not a website only)** because:

- 📱 **Most users request home or field services on-the-go.**  
- 🧭 **Providers use their phones to accept jobs and navigate to clients.**  
- 🔔 **Real-time notifications and location-based services work better natively on mobile.**  
- 💬 **Chat, booking, and feedback flows feel faster and more natural in a mobile UX.**

---

## 💡 **Technology Stack**

The project includes a **mobile application developed using React Native** and a **web interface built using React** for the frontend,  
and **Node.js** for the backend with **MySQL** for the database.  
It serves **three main user types:**  
👉 *Customer*, *Service Provider*, and *Administrator.*
